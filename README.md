## Summary

A quick boilerplate for Next.js projects with the following technologies ready to go:

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript 4
- ESLint
- Prettier

## How this was made

Simply put, I followed the setup instructions from the [Next.js setup guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started), then added the additional libraries mentioned above and configured them where necessary. Not a whole lot of work, in all honesty, but it definitely saves some time when spinning up new projects!

## How to use

1. Clone this repo to your local environment.

2. Navigate to the directory in your command line, and install all the required dependencies with **yarn**:

```
yarn install
```

3. To run the development server:

```
yarn dev
```

4. To build:

```
yarn build
```
